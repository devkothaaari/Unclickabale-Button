# Unclickabale-Button
A Simple Button(not too simple) made by using Html, CSS, and JavaScript.

Keep adding more to it.

The idea is to replace the old Submit button on Registration forms with this Notorious Button.
Use case - The user won't be able to click on this button until they fill in all the required information in the Registration form. (Or until the Password matched the dataset)
